What we are NOT making (WIP)

Profile pages
android/apple/mobile app
a service for users outside of UTA
An advertising platform


Possible outline for iterations:

1: diagramming of build plan ERR diagrams, possibly UML / skeleton of website hosted on personal machine

2: skeleton of website hosted on personal machine / building features into website / exploring public launch options

3: More features into website or cut features to focus on others / get website launched on some type of public solution

4: present working website with some users or examples of use at minimum / some refinement of features
